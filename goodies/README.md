Use these to better understand RGB and CMYK color dynamics.

JesseColorMap is how I view colors to keep track of differences. These only name colors by approximate hue, not by saturation or brightness. They are "spectrum" color names, not "real" color names nor "web color" Microsoft names.

The `RGB-CMYK-QHD/` folder has QHD (1920x1080) pictures illustrating RGB and CMYK. These are intended to be used on a phone or tablet to view at a distance.
